            <p>Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen and collect the red food. Each time you eat, your score will increase and your snake will get bigger. Avoid hitting your tail and get as much food as you can. Please calibrate eyetracking for this game.</p>

            <p>Use the arrow keys to move your white spaceship around the game screen. Defend yourself from the asteroid field, and blow up asteroids to increase your score. Watch out, as the larger asteroids break when hit, and will split into smaller asteroids! If an asteroid hits your ship, itâ€™s game over, so get blasting!

             <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
