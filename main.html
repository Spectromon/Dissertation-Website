        <p>Participant Information</p>
        <p>  My name is Tommy Carter, and I am a student at UEA and the lead researcher on this study. My supervisors for the research are Saber Sami and Michal Mackiewicz.
            The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of using games to help treat cognition-based illnesses such as dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s. </p>


            <p>To determine this, you, the participant, will complete a variety of games, where Eyetracking data and scores will be taken to evaluate how effective the games are at giving insight on cognitive ability. The Eyetracking data will be conglomerated into a heatmap, which will then be used as reference to determine engagement of the participant with the games, while scores will be taken to determine basic cognitive ability as well as determine how useful the game is. 
            Any and all data or information required or taken in the study will be hosted in a secure database provided by Heroku, a cloud-server hosting application. Only the lead researcher will have access to this data at any time, and any personal information (email etc) will not be distributed or discussed in the research but used, solely, to provide a randomly generated username and password to protect anonymity. 
            If there are any concerns about the study, research or data collection please do not hesitate to contact either me, or my supervisors on the details listed below.</p>
